CipherProject is a cross-platform desktop tool (built with Dear ImGui + C++17) that lets you experiment with classic ciphers in seconds—no command line required.
Key Features

    Three ciphers out-of-the-box

        Caesar – configurable integer shift

        S-DES – 8-bit teaching version of DES with 10-bit key, binary or decimal output

        Morse Code – bidirectional encode/decode

    Intuitive three-pane layout

        Left – quick text encrypt/decrypt

        Middle – radio-button cipher selector

        Right – full file encryption/decryption

    Robust input validation with modal error pop-ups (no silent failures)

    Auto-copy clipboard option and other tweakable settings

    ImGui HelpMarkers that give a one-sentence explanation of every cipher

    Single-file builds on Windows/MSVC; portable to other platforms with minimal tweaks.

Perfect for students, educators, and anyone who wants to visualise how simple ciphers work without touching a terminal.
